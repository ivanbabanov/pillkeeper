# pillkeeper

Pillkeeper is at simple React Native app which was developed for demonstrration needs. It uses Facebook auth and Firebase as backend.
Example usecase was to keep home medicine chest up to date.

Pillkeeper can add items manually or via barcode scanning
When barcode is scanned, pillkeeper tries to determine name of medicine by googling arcode value.

App was tested ony on iOS. And I think used React Native SDK is not up to date.
